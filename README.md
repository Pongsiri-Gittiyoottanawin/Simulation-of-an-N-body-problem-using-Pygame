# Simulation of an N-body problem using Pygame

This is a program written in the Python programming language using the Pygame library.
It simulates the movement of a number of "bodies" on a screen, where the bodies are represented by circles. The positions, velocities, and accelerations of the bodies are updated based on forces that are calculated between the bodies according to Newton's law of gravitation.
